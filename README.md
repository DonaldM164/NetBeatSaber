# NetBeatSaber
The goal of this project is to create a recurrent nueral network that is trained to generate beatmaps for the popular VR Game BeatSaber. This will allow more content for the game to be created at a faster rate by speeding up the beatmap creation process.  

    Objective:
        - Create a recurrent neural network that generates beatmaps with a focus on interesting yet familiar block patterns. Tackling the generation of obstacles and light events will also lie within the scope of this project.
        
        - Simplicity is key for the tool to be succesful, the user should only have to provide the song they wan't to generate a beatmap for and nothing more. The program should take care of the rest. 
        


A song, which can be decomposed into many different parts including (but not limited to):
    - Beats Per Minute
    - Harmonic (Tonal) signal
    - Percussive (Transient) signal
    - Mel-Frequency cepstrum (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel-frequency_cepstrum)
    - Chroma Features
