1
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:13,270
Now go pick up
those move controllers.

2
00:00:13,858 --> 00:00:17,294
Pick out a song
and lose control, yeah!

3
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,015
You'll feel the music
flowing through ya.

4
00:00:22,303 --> 00:00:26,665
And I don't want to
hear any excuses.

5
00:00:26,665 --> 00:00:29,000
Get your ass up,
Move around!

6
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,288
Swing your booty
to the sound!

7
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,790
Reach for the sun,
then drop it down!

8
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:36,210
Lift your arms
then swing 'em around!

9
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:38,785
If you don't want to shake it
I take it you want to make it...

10
00:00:38,785 --> 00:00:41,078
Appear as some kind of laid back
and chill dude but it's a straight fact...

11
00:00:41,078 --> 00:00:43,360
That you're whack if you don't check
that all the Box hacking and slashing...

12
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,635
Is better than button mashing
when playing the latest cash in...

13
00:00:45,635 --> 00:00:47,854
By studios, not even caring
if what they're making is fair and...

14
00:00:47,854 --> 00:00:50,100
All the numbers compared,
only some devs really care!

15
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,618
Invite some friends home and share.
The more the merrier!

16
00:00:52,618 --> 00:00:54,935
Today we're gonna
play some Beat Saber!

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,056
I don't want to alarm you,
but the way you move your arms...

18
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,378
Makes you look
a little Gaga.

19
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,175
But who cares
as long as you have Fun!

20
00:01:04,175 --> 00:01:08,770
If you want to shake it baby,
You ain't gonna make it, maybe...

21
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:13,291
You need to embrace it,
you don't have what it takes and run!

22
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,566
The lights are flashing, the music rocks.
A highspeed onslaught of moving blocks.

23
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,333
In all directions, in every spot.
If you missed a few take another shot!

24
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:27,040
You might want to go for the Highscore.
That's what the Leaderboards are there for.

25
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:28,222
Ooooohhhhhh...

26
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,050
